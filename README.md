# Due to the unscheduled maintenance, wind farms can loss precious time and that results in the loss of revenue. To this end, it is imporant to perform maintenance before it becomes too late. By continiously monitoring, turbine health, it is possible to detect the faults and schedule maintenance as needed. In this project, SCADA data collected from the wind farm in Ireland is used to evaluate the turbine performance.
Fault and alarm data are filtered and analysed in conjunction with the power curve to identify periods of normal and faulty operation. Also, the specific fault is identified.
The data consists of: 
Operational data: 
Status data
Warning data
